In this SQL project, I conducted an analysis of the `COVID-19 dataset`. My focus was on data exploration and I extracted the following information:
- The relationship between total cases and total deaths
- The relationship between total cases and population
- An examination of countries with the highest infection rate compared to population
- A display of countries with the highest death count
- A breakdown of data by continent
- A presentation of continents with the highest death count per population
- Global COVID statistics
- An investigation of the relationship between total population and vaccinations using a common table expression and a temporary table.
